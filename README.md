# SCHOOL-MANAGEMENT-APP
The School Management System is a mini-project built using Next.js and MySQL. It allows users to add school details and view schools in a responsive grid layout (like an e-commerce site). This project demonstrates form validation, image upload, and database integration using modern web technologies.
